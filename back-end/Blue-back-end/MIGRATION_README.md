# Market Data Separation

## Overview

This document describes the separation of market index functionality from the Stock-related classes back to dedicated market index classes. This separation improves code organization by clearly distinguishing between stocks and market indices.

## Changes Made

### Model Changes

- Updated `Stock.java` to remove market index fields:
  - Removed `isMarketIndex` boolean flag
  - Removed `code` field for market index code
  - Kept `change` and `changePercent` fields for stock price changes
  - Added `industry` and `marketCap` fields for better stock categorization

### DTO Changes

- Updated `StockDto.java` to remove market index fields:
  - Removed `isMarketIndex` boolean flag
  - Removed `code` field for market index code
  - Removed `change` field for direct change value
  - Added `industry` and `marketCap` fields

### Repository Changes

- Updated `StockRepository.java` to remove methods for market indices:
  - Removed `findByCodeAndIsMarketIndexTrue` method
  - Removed `findAllMarketIndices` method
  - Modified existing queries to remove market index filtering
  - Added methods for finding stocks by industry and market cap range

### Service Changes

- Updated `StockService.java` to remove market index functionality:
  - Removed methods related to market indices
  - Modified `convertToDto` to handle only stocks
  - Added methods for retrieving stocks by industry and market cap range

### Controller Changes

- Updated `StockController.java`:
  - Removed market index related endpoints
  - Updated market overview endpoint to exclude market indices
  - Added endpoints for retrieving stocks by industry and market cap range
- Created `MarketController.java` with dedicated endpoints for market data:
  - Added endpoints for retrieving market indices
  - Added endpoints for market-specific data like net flow, industry heatmap, etc.

## Added/Modified Files

- `MarketIndex.java` - Entity for market indices
- `MarketIndexDto.java` - DTO for market indices
- `MarketService.java` - Service for market-related operations
- `MarketIndexRepository.java` - Repository for market indices
- `MarketController.java` - Controller for market-related endpoints
- Additional market-related models and repositories for specialized market data

## Next Steps

1. Verify all market index functionality works correctly through the new endpoints
2. Update client applications to use the new market-specific endpoints
3. Consider adding more specialized market data endpoints as needed
